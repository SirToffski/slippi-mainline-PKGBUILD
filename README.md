# Introduction
This repository contains a PKGBUILD for building [Slippi Mainline Dolphin](https://github.com/project-slippi/dolphin). This repository also contains [pre-built packages](https://github.com/SirToffski/slippi-mainline-PKGBUILD/releases) for `x86-64-v3` and `x86-64-v2` CPUs using `gcc` and `clang`. Use those at your own risk because:

 1. Third party packages are unsupported by Slippi devs. Meaning you will likely not get any help on Slippi discord if you use these.
 2. Using random pre-built packages from the internet is inherently risky. You assume all responsibility if this somehow breaks your system.
